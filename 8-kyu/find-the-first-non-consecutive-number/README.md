If we have an array <code>[1,2,3,4,6,7,8]</code> then <code>1</code> then <code>2</code> then <code>3</code> then <code>4</code> are all consecutive but <code>6</code> is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.</p><p>If a non consecutive number is found then return <code>true</code> and set the passed in pointer to the number found.</p><p>If the whole array is consecutive then return <code>false</code>.</p><p>The array will always have at least <code>2</code> elements<sup>1</sup> and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!</p><hr><p><sup>1</sup> Can you write a solution that will return <code>false</code> for both <code>[]</code> and <code>[ x ]</code> (an empty array and one with a single number) though? (This is an empty array and one with a single number and is not tested for, but you can write your own example test. )</p>
